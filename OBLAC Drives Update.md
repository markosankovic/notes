## Recommendations

If you are updating from one major version to another, then we recommend that you don't skip major versions. Follow the instructions to incrementally update to the next major version, testing and validating at each step. For example, if you want to update from version 4.x.x to version 6.x.x, we recommend that you update to the latest 5.x.x release first. After successfully updating to 5.x.x, you can then update to 6.x.x.
