# Chapter 2 Selection Sort

## Arrays and linked lists

Arrays and linked lists are used to implement other data structures.

|            | Arrays  | Lists |
| ---------- |:-------:|:-----:|
| Reading    | O(1)    | O(n)  |
| Insertion  | O(n)    | O(1)  |

Lists are better for **insertion** and **deletion**. They provide *sequential access*.

Arrays are better for **selection** as they provide *random access*. They are faster at reads.

## Selection sort

## Recap

- Use an array or list for storing multiple elements.
- With an array, all elements are stored right next to each other.
- With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
- Arrays allow fast reads.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).
