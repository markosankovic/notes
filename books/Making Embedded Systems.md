#  Making Embedded Systems

## Chapter 1: Introduction

*An embedded system is a computerized system that is purpose built for its application.*

The hardware has contraints: CPU that runs more slowly to save battery power; system that uses less memory so it can be manufactured more cheaply; processors that come only in certain speeds or support a subset of peripherals.

In some systems, the software must act **deterministically** (exactly the same each time) or **real-time** (always reacting to an event fast enough).
