# Architecture Overview

Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.

The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for _components_.

An app always has at least a _root module_ that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more _feature modules_.
